menu "Sound support"

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND
	bool "Enable sound support"
	help
	  Support making sounds through an audio codec. This is normally a
	  beep at a chosen frequency for a selected length of time. However
	  the drivers support playing arbitrary sound samples using a
	  PCM interface.

	  Note: At present the sound setup is somewhat tangled up in that the
	  audio codecs are called from the sound-i2s code. This could be
	  converted to driver model.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S
	bool "Enable I2S support"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND
	help
	  I2S is a serial bus often used to transmit audio data from the
	  SoC to the audio codec. This option enables sound support using
	  I2S. It calls either of the two supported codecs (no use is made
	  of driver model at present).

config UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S_ROCKCHIP
	bool "Enable I2S support for Rockchip SoCs"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S
	help
	  Rockchip SoCs support an I2S interface for sending audio data to an
	  audio codec. This option enables support for this, using one of the
	  available audio codec drivers. This driver does not make use of
	  DMA, but writes each word directly to the hardware.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S_SAMSUNG
	bool "Enable I2C support for Samsung SoCs"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S
	help
	  Samsung Exynos SoCs support an I2S interface for sending audio
	  data to an audio codec. This option enables support for this,
	  using one of the available audio codec drivers. Enabling this
	  option provides an implementation for sound_init() and
	  sound_play().

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_DA7219
	bool "Dialog Semiconductor audio codec"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND
	help
	  The DA7219 is an ultra-low-power audio codec with Advanced Accessory
	  Detection (AAD). This driver only supports generation of ACPI tables.
	  It does not support sound output or any of the other codec
	  features.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_I8254
	bool "Intel i8254 timer / beeper"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND
	help
	  This enables support for a beeper that uses the i8254 timer chip.
	  This can emit beeps at a fixed frequency. It is possible to control
	  the length of the beeps, by turning a beep on, waiting for a period
	  of time, then turning it off.

	  This is quite an old feature, called PIT (Programmable Interval
	  Timer), but is nonetheless still available on modern x86 machines.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_INTEL_HDA
	bool "Intel HDA audio codec"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND
	help
	  Most Intel chips have an HDA (High-definition audio) codec which can
	  be used by U-Boot to play simple beeps. This is also sometimes called
	  Azalia which was the development code-name. It requires setup
	  information in the device tree (see intel-hda.txt).

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_IVYBRIDGE
	bool "Intel Ivybridge sound support"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND
	select UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_INTEL_HDA
	help
	  Enable sound output on supported Intel Ivybridge-based boards. This
	  driver uses Intel's High-definition Audio (HDA) architecture,
	  sometimes called Azalia. The audio codec is detected using a
	  semi-automatic mechanism.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S_TEGRA
	bool "Enable I2S support for Nvidia Tegra SoCs"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S
	select UBOOT_CONFIG_TEGRA124_DMA
	help
	  Nvidia Tegra SoCs support several I2S interfaces for sending audio
	  data to an audio codec. This option enables support for this,
	  using one of the available audio codec drivers.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_MAX98088
	bool "Support Maxim max98088 audio codec"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S
	help
	  Enable the max98088 audio codec. This is connected via I2S for
	  audio data and I2C for codec control. At present it only works
	  with the Samsung I2S driver.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_MAX98090
	bool "Support Maxim max98090 audio codec"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S
	help
	  Enable the max98090 audio codec. This is connected via I2S for
	  audio data and I2C for codec control. At present it only works
	  with the Samsung I2S driver.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_MAX98095
	bool "Support Maxim max98095 audio codec"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S
	help
	  Enable the max98095 audio codec. This is connected via I2S for
	  audio data and I2C for codec control. At present it only works
	  with the Samsung I2S driver.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_MAX98357A
	bool "Support Maxim max98357a audio codec"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_PCI
	help
	  Enable the max98357a audio codec. This is connected on PCI for
	  audio data codec control. This is currently only capable of providing
	  ACPI information. A full driver (with sound in U-Boot) is currently
	  not available.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_RT5677
	bool "Support Realtek RT5677 audio codec"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND
	help
	  Enable the Realtek RT5677 audio codec. This is an I2S device used on
	  some Chromebooks from around 2015 ('auron'). It is configured using
	  an I2C interface and supports multiple sound inputs and outputs,
	  including digital microphones.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_SANDBOX
	bool "Support sandbox emulated audio codec"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SANDBOX && UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND
	help
	  U-Boot sandbox can emulate a sound device using SDL, playing the
	  sound on the host machine. This option implements the sound_init()
	  and sound_play() functions for sandbox. Note that you must install
	  the SDL libraries for this to work.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SOUND_WM8994
	bool "Support Wolfson Micro wm8994 audio codec"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_I2S_SAMSUNG
	help
	  Enable the wm8994 audio codec. This is connected via I2S for
	  audio data and I2C for codec control. At present it only works
	  with the Samsung I2S driver.
