# VirtIO is a virtualization standard for network and disk device drivers
# where just the guest's device driver "knows" it is running in a virtual
# environment, and cooperates with the hypervisor. This enables guests to
# get high performance network and disk operations, and gives most of the
# performance benefits of paravirtualization. In the U-Boot case, the guest
# is U-Boot itself, while the virtual environment are normally QEMU targets
# like ARM, RISC-V and x86.
#
# See http://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.0/virtio-v1.0.pdf for
# the VirtIO specification v1.0.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO
	bool
	help
	  This option is selected by any driver which implements the virtio
	  transport, such as CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO or CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO
	bool "Platform bus driver for memory mapped virtio devices"
	select UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO
	help
	  This driver provides support for memory mapped virtio
	  platform device driver.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI
	bool "PCI driver for virtio devices"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_PCI
	select UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO
	help
	  This driver provides support for virtio based paravirtual device
	  drivers over PCI.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO_SANDBOX
	bool "Sandbox driver for virtio devices"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SANDBOX
	select UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO
	help
	  This driver provides support for Sandbox implementation of virtio
	  transport driver which is used for testing purpose only.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET
	bool "virtio net driver"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO
	help
	  This is the virtual net driver for virtio. It can be used with
	  QEMU based targets.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK
	bool "virtio block driver"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_VIRTIO
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_BLK
	help
	  This is the virtual block driver for virtio. It can be used with
	  QEMU based targets.
