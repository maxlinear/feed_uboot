config UBOOT_CONFIG_RAM
	bool "Enable RAM drivers using Driver Model"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_DM
	help
	  This allows drivers to be provided for SDRAM and other RAM
	  controllers and their type to be specified in the board's device
	  tree. Generally some parameters are required to set up the RAM and
	  the RAM size can either be statically defined or dynamically
	  detected.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SPL_RAM
	bool "Enable RAM support in SPL"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_RAM && UBOOT_CONFIG_SPL_DM
	help
	  The RAM subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use RAM drivers in
	  SPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up RAM (e.g. SDRAM / DDR) within SPL.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_TPL_RAM
	bool "Enable RAM support in TPL"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_RAM
	help
	  The RAM subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use RAM drivers in
	  TPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to

	  K3 based AM654 devices has DDR memory subsystem that comprises
	  Synopys DDR controller, Synopsis DDR phy and wrapper logic to
	  intergrate these blocks into the device. This DDR subsystem
	  provides an interface to external SDRAM devices. Enabling this
	  config add support for the initialization of the external
	  SDRAM devices connected to DDR subsystem.
