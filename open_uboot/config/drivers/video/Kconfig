config UBOOT_CONFIG_DM_VIDEO
	bool "Enable driver model support for LCD/video"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_DM
	help
	  This enables driver model for LCD and video devices. These support
	  a bitmap display of various sizes and depths which can be drawn on
	  to display a command-line console or splash screen. Enabling this
	  option compiles in the video uclass and routes all LCD/video access
	  through this.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_BACKLIGHT
	bool "Enable panel backlight uclass support"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_DM_VIDEO
	default y
	help
	  This provides backlight uclass driver that enables basic panel
	  backlight support.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_VIDEO_PCI_DEFAULT_FB_SIZE
	hex "Default framebuffer size to use if no drivers request it"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_DM_VIDEO
	default 0x1000000 if UBOOT_CONFIG_X86 && UBOOT_CONFIG_PCI
	default 0 if !(UBOOT_CONFIG_X86 && UBOOT_CONFIG_PCI)
	help
	  Generally, video drivers request the amount of memory they need for
	  the frame buffer when they are bound, by setting the size field in
	  struct video_uc_plat. That memory is then reserved for use after
	  relocation. But PCI drivers cannot be bound before relocation unless
	  they are mentioned in the devicetree.

	  With this value set appropriately, it is possible for PCI video
	  devices to have a framebuffer allocated by U-Boot.

	  Note: the framebuffer needs to be large enough to store all pixels at
	  maximum resolution. For example, at 1920 x 1200 with 32 bits per
	  pixel, 2560 * 1600 * 32 / 8 = 0xfa0000 bytes are needed.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_VIDEO_COPY
	bool "Enable copying the frame buffer to a hardware copy"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_DM_VIDEO
	help
	  On some machines (e.g. x86), reading from the frame buffer is very
	  slow because it is uncached. To improve performance, this feature
	  allows the frame buffer to be kept in cached memory (allocated by
	  U-Boot) and then copied to the hardware frame-buffer as needed.

	  To use this, your video driver must set @copy_base in
	  struct video_uc_plat.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_PWM

	  for the display.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_CONSOLE_ROTATION
	bool "Support rotated displays"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_DM_VIDEO
	help
	  Sometimes, for example if the display is mounted in portrait
	  mode or even if it's mounted landscape but rotated by 180degree,
	  we need to rotate our content of the display relative to the
	  framebuffer, so that user can read the messages which are
	  printed out. Enable this option to include a text driver which can
	  support this. The rotation is set by the 'rot' parameter in
	  struct video_priv: 0=unrotated, 1=90 degrees clockwise, 2=180
	  degrees, 3=270 degrees.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_CONSOLE_TRUETYPE
	bool "Support a console that uses TrueType fonts"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_DM_VIDEO
	help
	  TrueTrype fonts can provide outline-drawing capability rather than
	  needing to provide a bitmap for each font and size that is needed.
	  With this option you can adjust the text size and use a variety of
	  fonts. Note that this is noticeably slower than with normal console.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_DM_PANEL_HX8238D

	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_DM_VIDEO
	help
	  Support for HX-8238D LCD Panel

	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_CONSOLE_TRUETYPE
	default 18
	help
	  This sets the font size for the console. The size is measured in
	  pixels and is the nominal height of a character. Note that fonts
	  are commonly measured in 'points', being 1/72 inch (about 3.52mm).
	  However that measurement depends on the size of your display and
	  there is no standard display density. At present there is not a
	  method to select the display's physical size, which would allow
	  U-Boot to calculate the correct font size.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SYS_WHITE_ON_BLACK
	bool "Display console as white on a black background"

	 Normally the display is black on a white background, Enable this
	 option to invert this, i.e. white on a black background. This can be
	 better in low-light situations or to reduce eye strain in some
	 cases.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_NO_FB_CLEAR
	bool "Skip framebuffer clear"
	help
	  If firmware (whatever loads u-boot) has already put a splash image
	  on screen, you might want to preserve it until whatever u-boot
	  loads takes over the screen.  This, for example, can be used to
	  keep splash image on screen until grub graphical boot menu starts.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_PANEL
	bool "Enable panel uclass support"

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SPLASH_SCREEN
	bool "Show a splash-screen image"
	help
	  If this option is set, the environment is checked for a variable
	  "splashimage". If found, the usual display of logo, copyright and
	  system information on the LCD is suppressed and the BMP image at the
	  address specified in "splashimage" is loaded instead. The console is
	  redirected to the "nulldev", too. This allows for a "silent" boot
	  where a splash screen is loaded very quickly after power-on.

	  The splash_screen_prepare() function is a weak function defined in
	  common/splash.c. It is called as part of the splash screen display
	  sequence. It gives the board an opportunity to prepare the splash
	  image data before it is processed and sent to the frame buffer by
	  U-Boot. Define your own version to use this feature.

	  (see doc/README.displaying-bmps).

	  This option is useful for targets where, due to alignment
	  restrictions, an improperly aligned BMP image will cause a data
	  abort. If you think you will not have problems with unaligned
	  accesses (for example because your toolchain prevents them)
	  there is no need to set this option.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SPLASH_SCREEN_ALIGN
	bool "Allow positioning the splash image anywhere on the display"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SPLASH_SCREEN || UBOOT_CONFIG_CMD_BMP
	help
	  If this option is set the splash image can be freely positioned
	  on the screen. Environment variable "splashpos" specifies the
	  position as "x,y". If a positive number is given it is used as
	  number of pixel from left/top. If a negative number is given it
	  is used as number of pixel from right/bottom. You can also
	  specify 'm' for centering the image.

	  Example:
	  setenv splashpos m,m
	  	=> image at center of screen

	  setenv splashpos 30,20
	  	=> image at x = 30 and y = 20

	  setenv splashpos -10,m

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SPLASH_SOURCE
	bool "Control the source of the splash image"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SPLASH_SCREEN
	help
	  Use the splash_source.c library. This library provides facilities to
	  declare board specific splash image locations, routines for loading
	  splash image from supported locations, and a way of controlling the
	  selected splash location using the "splashsource" environment
	  variable.

	  This CONFIG works as follows:

	  - If splashsource is set to a supported location name as defined by
	    board code, use that splash location.
	  - If splashsource is undefined, use the first splash location as
	    default.
	  - If splashsource is set to an unsupported value, do not load a splash
	    screen.

	  A splash source location can describe either storage with raw data, a
	  storage formatted with a file system or a FIT image. In case of a
	  filesystem, the splash screen data is loaded as a file. The name of
	  the splash screen file can be controlled with the environment variable
	  "splashfile".

	  To enable loading the splash image from a FIT image, CONFIG_FIT must
	  be enabled. The FIT image has to start at the 'offset' field address
	  in the selected splash location. The name of splash image within the
	  FIT shall be specified by the environment variable "splashfile".

	  In case the environment variable "splashfile" is not defined the
	  default name 'splash.bmp' will be used.
