	bool "Enable STM32 video support"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_DM_VIDEO
	help
	  STM32 supports many video output options including RGB and
	  DSI. This option enables these supports which can be used on
	  devices which have RGB TFT or DSI display connected.

	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_VIDEO_STM32
	select UBOOT_CONFIG_VIDEO_BRIDGE
	select UBOOT_CONFIG_VIDEO_DW_MIPI_DSI
	help
	  This option enables support DSI internal bridge which can be used on
	  devices which have DSI devices connected.

	default 640
	help
	  The maximum horizontal resolution to support for the framebuffer.
	  This configuration is used for reserving/allocating memory for the
	  framebuffer during device-model binding/probing.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_VIDEO_STM32_MAX_YRES
	int "Maximum vertical resolution (for memory allocation purposes)"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_VIDEO_STM32
	default 480
	help
	  The maximum vertical resolution to support for the framebuffer.
	  This configuration is used for reserving/allocating memory for the
	  framebuffer during device-model binding/probing.

	default 16
	help
	  The maximum bits per pixel to support for the framebuffer.
	  This configuration is used for reserving/allocating memory for the
	  framebuffer during device-model binding/probing.
