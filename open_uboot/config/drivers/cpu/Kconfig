config UBOOT_CONFIG_CPU
	bool "Enable CPU drivers using Driver Model"
	help
	  This allows drivers to be provided for CPUs and their type to be
	  specified in the board's device tree. For boards which support
	  multiple CPUs, then normally have to be set up in U-Boot so that
	  they can work correctly in the OS. This provides a framework for
	  finding out information about available CPUs and making changes.
