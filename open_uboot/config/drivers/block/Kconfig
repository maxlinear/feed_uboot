	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_BLK
	default y
	help
	  This option enables a disk-block cache for all block devices.
	  This is most useful when accessing filesystems under U-Boot since
	  it will prevent repeated reads from directory structures and other
	  filesystem data structures.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_SPL_BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache in SPL"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SPL_BLK
	help
	  This option enables the disk-block cache in SPL

	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_TPL_BLK
	help
	  This option enables the disk-block cache in TPL

	help
	  Enable this to support media devices on top of UEFI. This enables
	  just the uclass so you also need a specific driver to make this do
	  anything.

	  For sandbox there is a test driver.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_EFI_MEDIA_SANDBOX
	bool "Sandbox EFI media driver"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_SANDBOX
	default y
	help
	  Enables a simple sandbox media driver, used for testing just the
	  EFI_MEDIA uclass. It does not do anything useful, since sandbox does
	  not actually support running on top of UEFI.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_EFI_MEDIA_BLK
	bool "EFI media block driver"
	depends on UBOOT_CONFIG_EFI_APP
	default y
	help
	  Enables a block driver for providing access to UEFI devices. This
	  allows use of block devices detected by the underlying UEFI
	  implementation. With this it is possible to use filesystems on these
	  devices, for example.

config UBOOT_CONFIG_IDE
	bool "Support IDE controllers"
	select UBOOT_CONFIG_HAVE_BLOCK_DEVICE
	help
	  Enables support for IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) hard drives.
	  This allows access to raw blocks and filesystems on an IDE drive
	  from U-Boot. See also CMD_IDE which provides an 'ide' command for
	  performing various IDE operations.
