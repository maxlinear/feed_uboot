menuconfig UBOOT_CONFIG_AXI
	bool "AXI bus drivers"
	help
	  Support AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) busses, a on-chip
	  interconnect specification for managing functional blocks in SoC
	  designs, which is also often used in designs involving FPGAs (e.g.
	  communication with IP cores in Xilinx FPGAs).

	  These types of busses expose a virtual address space that can be
	  accessed using different address widths (8, 16, and 32 are supported
	  for now).

	  Other similar bus architectures may be compatible as well.

	  Support for gdsys Integrated Hardware Systems Advanced eXtensible
	  Interface (IHS AXI) bus on a gdsys IHS FPGA used to communicate with

	  Support AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) emulation for the sandbox
